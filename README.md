3) This program will provide the link to checkout to the user on whatsapp.

# How to use the code
4) You will be needing a group on whatsapp called "Flipkart". You will also be needing a whatsapp account which will be used to take orders and send the link regarding the checkout details.
5) Then other family members/friends can join this group and order stuff they want.
6) One thing to note is that since this project is aimed towards ordering daily used products,therefore daily preferred items are already stored in a list and can be accessed via numbers which are basically indeces of the list.
7) One should provide his flipkart id and password in the beginning in the terminal once.
8) One should also login on whatsapp web from the account that will be used to send messages regarding order details to the users only once in the beginning of the program. 
9) Once the login is done, the program is ready to take orders.
