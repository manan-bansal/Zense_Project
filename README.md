# Overview
1) This project is basically for reducing the task of ordering the daily needed products again and again by searching the item on flipkart, then adding the items in the cart and then proceeding to checkout. 
2) By using this code,we can simply order by typing a number corresponding to the item needed and the program will do the rest. 
3) This program will provide the link to checkout to the user on whatsapp.
4) It will also give the information of the product that is not available

# How to use the code
1) You will be needing a group on whatsapp called "Flipkart". You will also be needing a whatsapp account which will be used to take orders and send the link regarding the checkout details.
2) Then other family members/friends can join this group and order stuff they want.
3) One thing to note is that since this project is aimed towards ordering daily used products,therefore daily preferred items are already stored in a list and can be accessed via numbers which are basically indeces of the list.
4) One should provide his flipkart id and password in the beginning in the terminal once.
5) One should also login on whatsapp web from the account that will be used to send messages regarding order details to the users only once in the beginning of the program. 
6) Once the login is done, the program is ready to take orders.
7) There is a format for typing the item codes in order to order them.
8) The user needs to type the item code and then press enter to come to the next line. 
9) Only one item code should be there in one line.
10) The user should add STOP at the end when he is finished with the list.
11) One important thing to note is that the user should not press the spacebar after typing the item code.
